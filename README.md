# failed game engine
a failed game engine from scratch written in handmade style completely in c without any libraries

## why?
- the code quality is shit
- no thought about the architecture
- very bad at coding

## whats so bad
thinking back 
- the engine is not separated into proper scopes
- the basic arch on which the engine was built is super bad
- audio system is trash
- string library is half assed
- font rendering is not proper

## whats okish
- the renderer was ok
- window creation was ok
- arena allocator was ok

## what to do
- learn to code
- learn some more ...
